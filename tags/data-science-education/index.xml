Some of these years were in senior leadership roles in delivery management, project management, CMMI, ISO, ISMS, PMO, etc. In 2010 I moved into project management training and consulting. In 2018, I was considering going back to technology but this time I wanted to pick up a completely new stack of technology. I decided I would move into Data Science and AI. I knew AI as much as any typical software development person in senior management knew about this. It means I was highly confident that I could pick this up quickly. On top of that lots of content is available on the internet, many YouTube channels, and many courses are available. I thought it should be a cakewalk for me. I started learning this technology in my own way in my committed free time. Within 5-6 months after lots of study I started realizing this was the way to get the knowledge but it could not help me get confident to solve the problem. The more I learned, the more I felt that I did not know how much I needed to learn or how far I needed to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many educators, researchers, voices for quality education for all have come to create their educational videos and share those with community members, peers, and learners from industries. Many subjects and topics like Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning have gained has huge popularity in the market because they have brought disruption in the existing businesses and knowledge is openly available in the market. If you have time and money, then it makes sense to join some full-time or part-time course from some good university and learn these subjects systematically in depth and detail. But, if time or/and money is the issue, and you know what you want to learn, then there are many YouTube channels. From there you can learn everything you need to become a good ML Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, DL Engineer, NLP Engineer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
