I’ve been trying it since it was launched by xAI on February 17, 2025, and it continues to surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people say AI/LLM/GenAI/NLP is nothing more than spitting out words fed to it during training, and that any model is only as good as the data given to it, I find myself asking a question: &amp;ldquo;Aside from a few top scientists and creative thinkers, don’t 99.999% of people do the same thing?&amp;rdquo; If you think humans are creative, you might assume some human behavior is original, arising purely from the situation and unconnected to the past. It’s like saying dreams have nothing to do with your waking life and are entirely new creations of the mind during sleep. That’s not true. Whatever humans dream is influenced by their past and waking experiences. Similarly, every action a human takes is shaped by the data fed to them over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This issue becomes especially heated when considering the different regional perspectives, particularly in South India. For instance, Tamil Nadu politicians strongly believe that Tamil is their primary language, while Sanskrit is often seen as North Indian. At the time of independence, few would have predicted that 75 years later, we would be struggling to develop our own AI technology—partly due to not making Sanskrit the national language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
