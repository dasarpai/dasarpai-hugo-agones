Some of these years were in senior leadership roles in delivery management, project management, CMMI, ISO, ISMS, PMO, etc. In 2010 I moved into project management training and consulting. In 2018, I was considering going back to technology but this time I wanted to pick up a completely new stack of technology. I decided I would move into Data Science and AI. I knew AI as much as any typical software development person in senior management knew about this. It means I was highly confident that I could pick this up quickly. On top of that lots of content is available on the internet, many YouTube channels, and many courses are available. I thought it should be a cakewalk for me. I started learning this technology in my own way in my committed free time. Within 5-6 months after lots of study I started realizing this was the way to get the knowledge but it could not help me get confident to solve the problem. The more I learned, the more I felt that I did not know how much I needed to learn or how far I needed to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With its unmatched typographic quality, precision, and versatility, LaTeX empowers users to create documents that transcend the boundaries of conventional word processing. In this article, I am listing major capabilities that make LaTeX the tool of choice for those who demand perfection in their documents, ready to learn some coding and don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for all this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is one of the heaviest work in any research work. If you are not on track or this process is taking unusually longer time, then it means you don&amp;rsquo;t have any guiding process or best practices in place. As per my experience during my MS in Data Science and Ph.D./DBA in AI-Natural Language Processing, I am writing my thoughts in this article. I am sure it will help you, especially if you are entering in the field of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
