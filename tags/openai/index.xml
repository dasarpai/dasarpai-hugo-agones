After than you need to create an API using &lt;a href=&#34;https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys&#34;&gt;API Key Link&lt;/a&gt;. You need to copy the api key and you replace the text below &amp;lt;OPENAI_API_KEY&amp;gt;. Being string the key should be within &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;. Keeping security in mind it is highly recommended that you do not put the API in the code file. Keep it at some secured place and read that file to fetch the API key. OpenAI gives you USD 5 free usage. After that you need to pay. For that you need to setup your credit card details on their system. They are very fair on the charges, just keep track of your usage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use any of their service they won&amp;rsquo;t charge anything for just having account with them. While doing any model finetuning or prediction openai tells you how much they will charge you for that particular command. My suggestion is if you are just experimenting then keep your dataset small so that you can manage your learning with USD 10-20.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6020-GPT-Usecases.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;GPT Usecases&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-gpt&#34;&gt;What is GPT?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GPT is a transformer. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse it with your electricity transformer! In Artificial Intelligence there are different kinds of neural network architectures to perform various tasks like classification, translation, segmentation, regression, etc. One of those architectures is transformer architecture. The Foundation of this architecture is based on another two architectures called encoder architecture and decoder architecture. There are lots of other technical complexity but for the business readers I am hiding that for that the time being, we will discuss that at some other place. In nutshell, GPT is a Transformer technology developed by OpenAI and it can perform several NLP tasks. NLP stands for natural language preprocessing. NLP tasks mean tasks like sentiment analysis of the text, text classification, topic modeling, translation, named entity recognition, and dozens of other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a &lt;strong&gt;language model&lt;/strong&gt;, which means if you type some text then it can understand and respond to you appropriately. At this point in time, it is not accepting voice commands, neither able to process images or videos. A &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose model&lt;/strong&gt; means it can understand the question coming from any domain of life. A domain may be vertical or horizontal. A vertical domain means where a vendor is supplying a product or service for a specific type of customer. A horizontal domain is where a vendor supplies products or services for all types of customer.  Healthcare, banking, logistic, insurance, agriculture, philosophy, history, and economics are one kind of verticals whereas&#xA;BPO, Quality Management, Software Development, Taxation, HR, IT Security, Accounting, Office Administration, Catering, and Entertainment are other kind of domains. A &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose model&lt;/strong&gt; can understand the questions from all aspects of life whether business vertical or horizontal or normal daily family or conflicts with other group members, family members, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
