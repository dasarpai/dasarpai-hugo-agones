<h2 id="why-to-finetune-a-llm">Why to finetune a LLM?</h2>
<p>Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) can provide several benefits, depending on your specific needs and objectives. Here are some key reasons to consider fine-tuning an LLM:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Specialization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning allows the model to become more proficient in specific domains, such as medical, legal, or technical fields, by training it on domain-specific data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task Adaptation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the model to perform better on particular tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, question-answering, translation, or other NLP tasks that require specialized knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Performance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance the model&rsquo;s performance by fine-tuning it on high-quality, relevant data, reducing errors and increasing accuracy for specific applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt the model to align with specific user preferences, company guidelines, or industry standards, providing more personalized responses and outputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tuning can be more cost-effective than training a new model from scratch, especially when computational resources are limited.</li>
<li>Entering long context and instruction everytime in the prompt is costly because you are paying for input tokens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Language and Cultural Adaptation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailor the model to better understand and generate text in specific languages, dialects, or cultural contexts, improving its relevance and usability for particular user bases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Biases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address and mitigate biases present in the base model by fine-tuning it on balanced and representative datasets, promoting fairness and inclusivity in its outputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating Knowledge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate the latest information and data, ensuring the model remains up-to-date with recent developments, trends, and knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the model complies with specific regulatory or legal requirements by fine-tuning it on compliant datasets and guidelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security and Privacy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fine-tune the model on proprietary or sensitive datasets in a secure environment to maintain data privacy and security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand Voice and Style</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt the model to reflect a specific brand&rsquo;s voice, tone, and style, ensuring consistency in communication and content generation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fine-tuning an LLM involves training the pre-trained model on a new dataset specific to your needs while adjusting its weights to improve performance on the target tasks. This process leverages the vast knowledge the model has already acquired, enhancing it with specific information and capabilities relevant to your use case.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fewshot-learning">What is fewshot learning?</h2>
<p>Assume I have a task where I want large langue model to convert words of different languages or different script into english 1,2,3 etc. For that I am using gpt4.0 with 20 shots. After this whatever number I give to the model it is able to translate correctly. This is a good example of few-shot learning. No weight is adjusted during the fewshot learning.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-meaning-of-this-1-shot-3-shot-5-shot-7-shot-learing">What is the meaning of this 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot, 7-shot learing?</h2>
<p>The terms &ldquo;1-shot&rdquo;, &ldquo;3-shot&rdquo;, &ldquo;5-shot&rdquo;, &ldquo;7-shot&rdquo;,  etc., refer to the number of examples provided to the model during the evaluation phase of few-shot learning. Few-shot learning is a technique where a model is given a small number of examples to understand the task before being evaluated. Here&rsquo;s a brief explanation of each term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1-shot Learning</strong>: The model is given one example of the task to learn from before being tested. This helps in assessing how well the model can generalize from a single instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3-shot Learning</strong>: The model is provided with three examples to learn from before the evaluation. This gives a bit more context than 1-shot but still requires strong generalization capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5-shot Learning</strong>: The model is given five examples to understand the task before being tested. This allows the model to see a variety of instances to better understand the task requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7-shot Learning</strong>: The model learns from seven examples before being evaluated. This provides more context and helps the model to generalize better than lower-shot scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>25-shot Learning</strong>: The model is provided with twenty-five examples to learn from. This is typically used in more complex tasks where more examples are needed to grasp the nuances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-use-few-shot-learning">Why Use Few-Shot Learning?</h3>
<p>Few-shot learning is valuable because it assesses a model&rsquo;s ability to generalize from a small number of examples. This mimics real-world scenarios where large labeled datasets may not be available. It helps in understanding the model&rsquo;s capability to adapt to new tasks with minimal guidance, which is crucial for versatile AI systems.</p>
<h3 id="examples-in-context">Examples in Context</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MMLU (5-shot)</strong>: The model is shown five examples of each academic subject before being tested.</li>
<li><strong>AGIEval English (3-5 shot)</strong>: The model learns from three to five examples for each English proficiency task.</li>
<li><strong>CommonSenseQA (7-shot)</strong>: Seven examples are given to the model to teach common sense reasoning before evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Winogrande (5-shot)</strong>: The model receives five examples to resolve sentence ambiguities before being tested.</li>
<li><strong>BIG-Bench Hard (3-shot, CoT)</strong>: The model is provided with three examples for each challenging task, using chain-of-thought prompting.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach helps to benchmark how well language models can adapt to new tasks with limited information.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-in-the-model-during-few-shot-learning">What happens in the model during few shot learning?</h2>
<p>During few-shot learning, a pre-trained model uses a small number of examples provided as part of the prompt to understand how to perform a specific task. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens in the model during this process:</p>
<h3 id="contextual-understanding">Contextual Understanding</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-Trained Knowledge</strong>: The model, having been pre-trained on a large corpus of data, already possesses a vast amount of general knowledge about language, facts, and various tasks. This foundational knowledge is crucial for few-shot learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task Presentation</strong>: When the model is presented with a few-shot task, it receives a prompt that includes a few examples (shots) of input-output pairs. These examples are intended to illustrate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-processing">Example Processing</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>: The model analyzes the provided examples to recognize patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs. For instance, in a question-answering task, it observes how questions are structured and how answers are formulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Embedding</strong>: The model generates embeddings (dense vector representations) for the inputs and outputs in the examples. These embeddings capture the semantic information and context of the examples, helping the model understand the task.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="generalization">Generalization</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Inference</strong>: Using its pre-trained knowledge and the patterns identified from the few examples, the model generalizes to infer the rules or the method required to perform the task. This step relies heavily on the model’s ability to generalize from limited data.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="application">Application</h3>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Prediction</strong>: Once the model has inferred the task’s rules, it applies this understanding to make predictions on new, unseen inputs. It uses the context from the examples to guide its responses.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-workflow">Example Workflow</h3>
<p>Let’s consider a few-shot learning task where the model is required to perform sentiment analysis:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="model-process">Model Process</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyze Examples</strong>: The model reads the examples and identifies that they are instances of sentiment analysis, where the task is to determine whether the sentiment expressed in each sentence is positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generate Embeddings</strong>: It creates embeddings for the inputs and outputs of the examples, capturing the semantic information and sentiment expressed in each sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infer Rules</strong>: The model uses the examples to infer that it needs to classify the sentiment of the new input sentence based on the patterns it recognized (e.g., words like &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; indicate positive sentiment, while &ldquo;boring&rdquo; indicates negative sentiment).</p>
