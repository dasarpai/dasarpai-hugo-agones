<h1 id="exploring-ai-agents">Exploring AI Agents</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As of the start of 2025, we are hearing a lot of buzz around Agents, Workflow, System, AI Employee etc. In this article, we are trying to understand some important concepts around these terms in question answer format. These answers are derived from general AI knowledge, principles, and concepts based on publicly available information about AI agents, workflows, and systems. Specific sources include academic literature, industry whitepapers, and commonly understood practices in AI development and usage.</p>
<h2 id="q1-what-is-an-ai-agent">Q1: What is an AI Agent?</h2>
<p>An AI Agent is a program that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes actions to achieve specific goals. It uses artificial intelligence to make decisions and interact autonomously or semi-autonomously with users or systems.</p>
<h2 id="q2-what-are-the-different-types-of-ai-agents">Q2: What are the different types of AI Agents?</h2>
<p>AI agents can be categorized into simple reflex agents (like switching heater or AC on based on temperature), model-based agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents. These types vary based on complexity and functionality.</p>
<h2 id="q3-in-the-context-of-ai-what-are-the-different-meanings-of-agent-explain-with-examples">Q3: In the context of AI, what are the different meanings of &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;? Explain with examples.</h2>
<p>In AI, &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; can mean</p>
<ul>
<li>a software program performing tasks, e.g. a chatbot, this is assistant avatar of Agent</li>
<li>a physical robot acting in the real world, e.g. autonomous vehicles, this is physically doing some work</li>
<li>a component within a larger system, e.g. an optimization agent in logistics, it like component of a complex business process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q4-what-is-a-virtual-collaborator-as-term-used-by-claudeai">Q4: What is a Virtual Collaborator, as term used by Claude.ai?</h2>
<p>A Virtual Collaborator, like those used in Claude.ai, refers to an AI-powered assistant designed to help users with tasks, provide insights, and streamline workflows through natural language interactions. They are referring to &ldquo;agent&rdquo; but to avoid the confusion of this term they used this term.</p>
<h2 id="q5-what-is-a-workflow">Q5: What is a workflow?</h2>
<p>A workflow is a sequence of tasks or processes that are structured to achieve a specific outcome. It can involve humans, systems, or AI agents working together to complete activities.</p>
<h2 id="q6-can-we-say-a-chatbot-is-an-agent">Q6: Can we say a Chatbot is an Agent?</h2>
<p>Yes, a chatbot is a type of AI agent. It perceives user input, processes it, and generates responses to fulfill user needs.</p>
<h2 id="q7-what-is-a-system">Q7: What is a System?</h2>
<p>A system is a collection of interconnected components that work together to perform specific functions. It can include hardware, software, data, AI agents, AI models, and human users. To have a good system we need good system design and we cannot make them great just by using expensive LLMs. We can make good system even with a SLM (small language models), but for that we need to understand business problem in depth and create a system around that.</p>
<h2 id="q8-what-is-an-ai-model">Q8: What is an AI Model?</h2>
<p>An AI model is a mathematical representation of a problem, trained on data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions. Examples include language models and computer vision models. GenAI Language models are used to generate text, GenAI vision models are used to generate images and video, GenAI multi models can generate text, audio, images, and video. They can be used by AI Agents to perform certain tasks.</p>
<h2 id="q9-when-should-we-use-workflows">Q9: When should we use workflows?</h2>
<p>Workflows are best used when tasks have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly defined goals.</li>
<li>Clean and structured data.</li>
<li>Predictable data inputs and processing methods.</li>
<li>Requirements for repeatability, consistency, and scalability.</li>
<li>Involvement of multiple people, departments, or organizations with well-defined roles and timelines.</li>
<li>No uncertainty or probabilistic elements in the process, ensuring all steps are deterministic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q10-when-should-we-use-agents-or-virtual-collaborators">Q10: When should we use Agents or Virtual Collaborators?</h2>
<p>Agents or virtual collaborators are ideal when tasks involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic decision-making.</li>
<li>Unpredictable data inputs that cannot be predefined.</li>
<li>Uncertainty in processing methods or next steps.</li>
<li>A need for different types of intelligence to perform various tasks autonomously.</li>
<li>Adaptability to handle complex, evolving situations where predefined workflows are insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q11-based-on-the-abilities-of-ai-models-can-you-group-them-into-categories-in-terms-of-progress">Q11: Based on the abilities of AI models, can you group them into categories in terms of progress?</h2>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> These AI models handle specific tasks with predefined inputs and outputs, processing structured data and performing repetitive tasks efficiently. For example, a virtual assistant that schedules appointments or sets reminders.</p>
<p><strong>Copilot:</strong> AI copilots work alongside users, providing suggestions and augmenting human decision-making. They process unstructured data and adapt to various contexts, enhancing productivity and creativity. For instance, Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot assists users in writing code by suggesting completions and debugging tips. (<a href="https://www.rezolve.ai/blog/ai-co-pilot-vs-agentic-ai-key-differences">GenAI Employee Service Desk</a></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> These AI models possess advanced reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex problems, make inferences, and understand nuanced contexts. They handle ambiguous situations and provide logical solutions. An example is OpenAI&rsquo;s o3 mini model, which excels in reasoning through complex tasks in various fields, including science, coding, and math.</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> AI agents are autonomous systems capable of performing tasks on behalf of users or other systems. They can design their workflows, utilize available tools, and make decisions based on external data sets. Unlike assistants, AI agents can operate independently, requiring minimal human input. (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents">IBM - United States</a></p>
<h2 id="q12-how-do-ai-agents-interact-with-workflows-and-systems">Q12: How do AI agents interact with workflows and systems?</h2>
<p>AI agents can trigger workflows, perform tasks within workflows, and integrate with systems to retrieve or process data and execute decisions. Or some external trigger can initiate the agent. For example an email received from vendor can be analyzed and answered.</p>
<h2 id="q13-what-are-the-key-components-of-an-ai-agent">Q13: What are the key components of an AI agent?</h2>
<p>An AI agent comprises several key components that enable it to perceive, reason, and act within its environment:</p>
<p><strong>Sensors:</strong> These components allow the agent to perceive its environment by collecting data from various sources, such as cameras, microphones, or other input devices.</p>
<p><strong>Actuators:</strong> Actuators enable the agent to perform actions in the environment, such as moving, speaking, or interacting with other systems.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> This is a repository where the agent stores information about its environment, experiences, and learned knowledge, facilitating informed decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning Engine:</strong> The reasoning engine processes information from the knowledge base to make decisions, solve problems, and plan actions.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Mechanism:</strong> This component allows the agent to learn from experiences and adapt its behavior over time, improving its performance and decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>These components work together to enable AI agents to operate autonomously, interact with their environment, and achieve their objectives.</p>
