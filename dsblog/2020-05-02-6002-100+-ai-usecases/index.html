In today’s volatile job market and business environment, what should I learn to secure my future? I’m not a technology expert—will AI render me redundant? Where is AI?

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Nowadays, we frequently hear and read about AI and its role in shaping both our present and future. However, many people, even those who are tech-savvy, struggle to understand and answer some fundamental questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)? Is it just another buzzword in technology?</li>
<li>What exactly can I do with AI?</li>
<li>How will AI affect my job and life?</li>
<li>In today’s volatile job market and business environment, what should I learn to secure my future?</li>
<li>I’m not a technology expert—will AI render me redundant?</li>
<li>Where is AI? I only see electronic gadgets around me.</li>
<li>What is the relationship between AI, ML (Machine Learning), Automation, Robotics, IoT, and similar technologies?</li>
<li>And many other questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, there are professionals with degrees in Data Science, AI, and ML who want to pursue their passion for building and researching meaningful, practical projects within limited timeframes and resources. Yet, many of them struggle to identify viable opportunities.</p>
<p>I manage a very active WhatsApp group, <strong>“AI &amp; Business Trends,”</strong> which brings together passionate AI enthusiasts. In this group, we played a game called <strong>“Planting AI in My Field.”</strong> Members actively participated and generated a variety of innovative ideas.</p>
<p>In this article, I have compiled those ideas. A list of contributors is mentioned at the end, along with links to their LinkedIn profiles for networking purposes. The objective of this article is to inspire readers to explore what is possible with AI and encourage them to take the first step toward creating something meaningful. If you have more ideas to share or wish to refine the existing ones, please join our group or comment below.</p>
<p>A few questions remain unanswered in this article and are left for readers to ponder:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will be the benefits of these systems or ideas?</li>
<li>Who (which roles or professions) will benefit from them?</li>
<li>Are there any existing AI-based applications in the market that provide these features, either individually or as a combination?</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the ideas listed here have already been implemented. By the time you read this article, it’s possible that these ideas will have become a reality. For clarity and readability, I have refined the ideas and language from the original WhatsApp group discussion. Note that the ideas are presented in no particular order.</p>
