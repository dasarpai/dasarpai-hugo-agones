<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>No other models do justice to Sanskrit in terms of context, context length, word meaning, and translation as Grok 3 does. I’ve been trying it since it was launched by xAI on February 17, 2025, and it continues to surprise me.</p>
<p>When people say AI/LLM/GenAI/NLP is nothing more than spitting out words fed to it during training, and that any model is only as good as the data given to it, I find myself asking a question: &ldquo;Aside from a few top scientists and creative thinkers, don’t 99.999% of people do the same thing?&rdquo; If you think humans are creative, you might assume some human behavior is original, arising purely from the situation and unconnected to the past. It’s like saying dreams have nothing to do with your waking life and are entirely new creations of the mind during sleep. That’s not true. Whatever humans dream is influenced by their past and waking experiences. Similarly, every action a human takes is shaped by the data fed to them over time.</p>
<p>If we assume Earth has a population of 8 billion, then 0.001% equals 80,000 people. This means 80,000 people are exceptionally brilliant and capable of original thought (at the level of nobel prize), while the remaining 99.999% are, in a sense, no different from an AI chatbot. We may not like this idea, but it’s the truth about our so-called creativity and originality. When AI companies and researchers making a new model they not checking performance against your district or state of country topper in 10th or 12th or University or UPSC exam toppers. They are checking the performance on world toppers. Whether maths or physics or chemistry or biology or history or ecnomics or music or art or movies or computer programming or any other subject they are picking world toppers. As per some rough estimate let&rsquo;s assume there 29 million programmers in the world. Then as per the recent report AI can beat 99% of programmer behind. So, 1% of 29 million is 290,000. That means only 290,000 programmers will be able to beat the AI in programming. Not only this there are some AI Model which are so good they are among 175 best programmers in the world! Similarly for other subjects they are picking olympiad level problems and trying solve using AI. As of today some of these models are costly but in comparison to human cost of doing work they are damn cheap. And in coming time they will as cheap as our mobile data in India.</p>
<p>For now, let&rsquo;s not divert from the topic of this article. Let&rsquo;s explore what Grok 3 can do with the Sanskrit language. To keep this article concise, I&rsquo;ll share just one prompt with you. Pause for a moment, read my prompt and the AI&rsquo;s answer carefully. And then ask yourself: apart from a Sanskrit scholar, who can do this work? In the world, how many people understand Sanskrit today? And among those who understand, who is capable of doing this kind of work? And then we can do this within 90 seconds!</p>
<h2 id="my-prompt">My Prompt</h2>
<p>In bhagwat gita if we want to find the definition of any concept then we need to look for a word like च्यते. Is there any other words which we should look for?</p>
<h2 id="grok-answer">Grok Answer</h2>
<p>In the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, when seeking definitions or explanations of concepts, Sanskrit words like च्यते (<em>chyate</em>)—which often appears in verbal forms indicating something being &ldquo;spoken,&rdquo; &ldquo;explained,&rdquo; or &ldquo;cut&rdquo; (from the root <em>chid</em>, meaning to cut or discern)—can indeed be a clue. However, the <em>Gita</em> doesn&rsquo;t follow a rigid formula where a single word consistently signals a definition. Instead, it uses a variety of terms and contextual cues to elaborate on philosophical or spiritual concepts. Here are some other Sanskrit words or patterns to look for when trying to identify explanations or definitions of concepts in the <em>Gita</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>उच्यते (<em>uchyate</em>)</strong>: This means &ldquo;it is said&rdquo; or &ldquo;it is called.&rdquo; It’s frequently used when Krishna introduces or defines a concept, such as in verses where he explains yoga, dharma, or the nature of the self (<em>atman</em>). For example, in Chapter 2, Verse 11 (<em>śrī-bhagavān uvāca</em>), Krishna begins explaining key ideas, often followed by <em>uchyate</em> to denote authoritative teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>लक्षणम् (<em>lakṣaṇam</em>)</strong>: This word means &ldquo;characteristic,&rdquo; &ldquo;sign,&rdquo; or &ldquo;definition.&rdquo; When it appears, it often signals that the text is about to describe the qualities or defining traits of a concept, like <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> or <em>sthita-prajña</em> (a steady-minded person). Check Chapter 2, Verse 54-72, where Krishna defines the traits of a liberated soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>तत्त्वम् (<em>tattvam</em>)</strong>: Meaning &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;essence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; this word often introduces the core nature of something. For instance, in Chapter 13, Krishna discusses <em>kṣetra</em> (the field) and <em>kṣetrajña</em> (the knower of the field), using <em>tattvam</em> to signify their essential truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>इति (<em>iti</em>)</strong>: This word, meaning &ldquo;thus&rdquo; or &ldquo;in this way,&rdquo; often concludes an explanation or definition, summarizing what has been said. It’s like a textual marker saying, &ldquo;This is the concept explained.&rdquo; You’ll see it frequently, such as in Chapter 6, Verse 46, where Krishna wraps up a point about yogis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ज्ञानम् (<em>jñānam</em>)</strong>: Meaning &ldquo;knowledge,&rdquo; this term often precedes or accompanies an exposition of a concept, especially when Krishna elaborates on wisdom, self-realization, or the nature of existence. Look at Chapter 4, where <em>jñāna-yoga</em> (the yoga of knowledge) is unpacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>यः (<em>yaḥ</em>) or यत् (<em>yat</em>)</strong>: These relative pronouns (&ldquo;he who&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which&rdquo;) often introduce descriptions of a concept through its qualities or the person embodying it. For example, in Chapter 2, Verse 55, Krishna describes the <em>sthita-prajña</em> with <em>yaḥ</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than focusing solely on specific words, it’s also useful to pay attention to the structure of the <em>Gita</em>. Krishna often defines concepts by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contrasting opposites</strong>: E.g., bondage vs. liberation, ignorance vs. knowledge (Chapters 2 and 5).</li>
<li><strong>Listing qualities</strong>: E.g., traits of a devotee or a yogi (Chapters 12 and 6).</li>
<li><strong>Using metaphors or examples</strong>: E.g., the chariot analogy in Chapter 1 or the ocean analogy in Chapter 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while च्यते might catch your eye, words like <em>uchyate</em>, <em>lakṣaṇam</em>, <em>tattvam</em>, <em>iti</em>, and <em>jñānam</em>—along with contextual patterns—are equally important markers for uncovering definitions in the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. If you’re analyzing a specific concept, let me know which one, and I can help you pinpoint where and how it’s defined!</p>
