# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Completed implementation of the custom layout for the `dsblog` section, including centered content, right-hand Table of Contents (TOC) sidebar, and additional features based on user feedback.

## Recent Changes

*   Initialized the core Memory Bank files.
*   Modified `layouts/dsblog/baseof.html` for centered content and TOC sidebar structure, including basic CSS for image overflow and header overlap.
*   Created `layouts/partials/dsblog/pager.html` and included it in `layouts/dsblog/single.html` for previous/next article navigation.
*   Added code to `layouts/dsblog/single.html` to display categories and tags.
*   Created `layouts/partials/dsblog/about-author.html` and included it in `layouts/dsblog/single.html` for the author section.
*   Created `layouts/partials/dsblog/social-share.html` and included it in `layouts/dsblog/single.html` for social sharing buttons.
*   Created `layouts/partials/dsblog/giscus-comments.html` and included it in `layouts/dsblog/single.html` for the Giscus comment section.
*   Modified `layouts/partials/footer.html` to include a new row for important menu items from `config.toml`, correcting the method for accessing menus by name.

## Next Steps

1.  User to verify the implemented layout and features by running the Hugo server and viewing a `dsblog` article.
2.  User to provide feedback on any necessary CSS adjustments for styling and responsiveness.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   Used Bootstrap grid classes for the main layout structure.
*   Utilized Hugo's built-in variables for TOC, pagination, and taxonomies.
*   Created dedicated partials for modularity (pager, about author, social share, giscus comments).
*   Integrated configuration details from `config.toml` for author, Giscus, and footer menus.
*   Corrected menu access in `layouts/partials/footer.html` using `index site.Menus $name`.
*   Added basic inline CSS for initial styling; dedicated CSS file is recommended for production.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Hugo's templating system allows for flexible customization of layouts and inclusion of dynamic content.
*   Partials are effective for reusing code blocks across different layouts.
*   Configuration details in `config.toml` can be easily accessed within templates.
*   Implementing complex layouts and features often requires a combination of HTML structure, Hugo templating, and CSS styling.
*   Careful attention to Hugo's specific function and variable access syntax is crucial for correct template execution.
