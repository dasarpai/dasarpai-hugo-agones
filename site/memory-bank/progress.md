# Progress

## What Works

*   The basic Hugo project structure is in place.

*   The Memory Bank core files have been initialized.

## What's Left to Build

*   User to verify all implemented features in a browser.
*   Add or adjust CSS for proper styling and responsiveness of all new elements.

## Current Status

All requested features for the `dsblog` single article layout have been implemented and the footer menu access issue has been corrected. The Memory Bank is updated.

## Known Issues

*   None identified yet related to the current task.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Decision to use a dedicated `dsblog` layout directory for section-specific customization.
*   Decision to use the Memory Bank for project context and continuity.
